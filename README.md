# SonificationExperiment2
This patch is another audio visual generator in which attributes of the visual content are used to determine the outcome of the audio.

The screen has been split into four sections, each representing a sound. Each sound is being controlled or modulated by different attributes of the algorithmically generated circles. For a full account of what is controlling what see ‘OpenThisFile’.

Note: As with most of the patches on my github, my patches are designed to be self contained. As such it’s best to download the folder as a zip, change the instructed file directories and evaluate the file path in ‘OpenThisFile’.
